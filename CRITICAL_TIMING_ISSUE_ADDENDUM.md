# CRITICAL TIMING ISSUE ADDENDUM - September 11, 2025

## 🚨 **URGENT: Impact Timing Calculation Broken During Log Cleanup**

### **Issue Summary**
The accurate impact timing calculation we worked extensively to develop has been corrupted during today's log formatting cleanup. The 44.21s error you observed indicates we're using raw system timestamps instead of the calibrated statistical timing system we built.

---

## 🔬 **Root Cause Analysis from Chat History**

### **Original Working System (Pre-September 11, 2025)**
Based on the semantic search, we had a sophisticated timing system with these components:

#### **1. Statistical Timing Calibration System**
- **File**: `src/impact_bridge/statistical_timing_calibration.py`
- **Purpose**: 83ms median offset calibration from 51 correlations (152 shots, 101 impacts)
- **Key Function**: `project_impact_time()` - projects when impact should occur based on AMG shot time

#### **2. Enhanced Impact Detection**  
- **File**: `src/impact_bridge/enhanced_impact_detection.py`
- **Purpose**: Onset-first detection (30g threshold) vs peak-first (150g)
- **Critical**: Uses `onset_timestamp` as the TRUE impact start time

#### **3. Timing Calibration Integration**
- **File**: `src/impact_bridge/timing_calibration.py`  
- **Purpose**: Real-time correlation between AMG shots and BT50 impacts
- **Key Function**: `add_shot_event()`, `add_impact_event()`, correlation logic

## 🎯 **What We Broke Today**

### **Current Broken Logic in `fixed_bridge.py` (lines 614-634):**
```python
# ❌ WRONG: Using raw timestamps instead of calibrated projections
if self.start_beep_time:
    time_from_start = (actual_shot_time - self.start_beep_time).total_seconds()

time_from_shot = (impact_event.onset_timestamp - actual_shot_time).total_seconds()
```

### **Problems:**
1. **`time_from_start` Issue**: Using `actual_shot_time - self.start_beep_time` gives AMG timer progression (0.69s, 2.35s), but impact should show IMPACT timing from string start
2. **Missing Statistical Calibration**: Not using the 83ms median offset we built
3. **Ignoring Projected Times**: The `self.last_projection['projected_time']` contains calibrated timing but we're not using it

---

## 📊 **The Original Working Formula (From Chat History)**

Based on analysis of `statistical_timing_calibration.py` and `timing_integration.py`:

### **Correct Impact Timing Formula:**
```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Use calibrated statistical timing
if hasattr(self, 'last_projection') and self.last_projection:
    # Get the calibrated shot timestamp (AMG + timer offset)
    calibrated_shot_time = self.last_projection['shot_time']
    
    # Time from shot: actual delay vs statistical prediction (should be ~83ms)
    time_from_shot = (impact_event.onset_timestamp - calibrated_shot_time).total_seconds()
    
    # Time from string start: use IMPACT onset timestamp, not shot timestamp
    if self.start_beep_time:
        time_from_start = (impact_event.onset_timestamp - self.start_beep_time).total_seconds()
```

### **Why This Matters:**
- **`time_from_start`**: Should show when impact occurred relative to string start (not when shot occurred)
- **`time_from_shot`**: Should show ~0.083s (83ms statistical delay) between acoustic detection and physical onset
- **Statistical Validation**: This correlates with our 51-sample analysis showing 83ms median delay

---

## 🔧 **The Fix We Need**

### **Update `fixed_bridge.py` lines 620-630:**
```python
# Calculate timing using IMPACT timestamps with statistical calibration
if hasattr(self, 'last_projection') and self.last_projection:
    calibrated_shot_time = self.last_projection['shot_time']
    
    # Time from shot: Should show statistical delay (~83ms)
    time_from_shot = (impact_event.onset_timestamp - calibrated_shot_time).total_seconds()
    
    # Time from string start: Use IMPACT onset time (when it actually happened)
    if self.start_beep_time:
        time_from_start = (impact_event.onset_timestamp - self.start_beep_time).total_seconds()
```

## 📈 **Expected Results After Fix**

### **Before Fix (Current Broken State):**
```
💥String 2, Impact #1: Time 44.21s, Shot->Impact: 43.519s, Peak 524g
```
**Issues**: 44.21s is system uptime, 43.5s is meaningless

### **After Fix (Correct Calibrated Timing):**
```
💥String 2, Impact #1: Time 1.45s, Shot->Impact: 0.083s, Peak 524g
```
**Correct**: 1.45s = when impact occurred in string, 0.083s = acoustic-physical delay

## 🎯 **Historical Context from Chat History**

### **Key Achievements We Built:**
1. **Enhanced Impact Detection**: Onset-before-peak detection with 30g threshold
2. **Statistical Calibration**: 83ms ±94ms delay from large sample analysis  
3. **AMG Protocol**: Complete hex parsing with byte 13 string numbers, byte 2 shot counters
4. **Timing Correlation**: Real-time shot-to-impact matching with confidence scoring

### **Test Results Documented:**
- **TIMING_BUG_FIXED.md**: Documents the onset detection fix
- **STATISTICAL_TIMING_SUMMARY.md**: 51 correlations showing 83ms median delay
- **Multiple Test Sessions**: Hammer tests showing 87.5% correlation rates

## 🚀 **Action Plan for Tomorrow's Fast Start**

### **Priority 1: Restore Timing Calculation**
1. **Fix `fixed_bridge.py`** lines 620-630 with correct formula above
2. **Test with AMG timer** to validate timing shows proper progression
3. **Verify statistical calibration** shows ~83ms Shot->Impact delays

### **Priority 2: Validate Integration**
1. **Check correlation confidence** scores are working
2. **Verify onset detection** is still functioning correctly  
3. **Test string progression** matches AMG timer values

### **Priority 3: Live Fire Testing**
1. **Monitor timing accuracy** during actual shooting
2. **Collect new statistical data** to refine calibration
3. **Document performance** for system optimization
