# 🎯 FIXED: Enhanced Impact Detection - Correct Onset Timing!

## ✅ **CRITICAL BUG FIXED**

### **The Problem You Identified:**
> **"I see onset after the peak. Is this correct?"**

**NO!** You caught a critical timing logic error:

```
❌ BROKEN: onset 09:37:13.742 (1.4g) → peak 09:37:13.169 (267.0g) [+-573ms]
```
**Onset timestamp was AFTER peak timestamp** - completely wrong!

### **Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Wrong Detection Trigger**: System detected impact at **peak threshold (150g)** 
2. **Backward Looking**: Then tried to find onset by looking backward in history
3. **Timing Confusion**: Mixed up baseline samples with actual onset samples
4. **Wrong Assignment**: Assigned baseline magnitude as "onset magnitude"

## 🔧 **Complete Algorithm Redesign**

### **Old (Broken) Logic:**
```python
# ❌ WRONG: Detect peak first, then look backward
if magnitude >= 150g:  # Peak threshold
    start_impact_detection()
    find_onset_backwards()  # Already too late!
```

### **New (Correct) Logic:** 
```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Detect onset first, then track to peak
if magnitude >= 30g:   # Onset threshold (much lower)
    start_impact_detection()  # Begin recording immediately
    continue_until_baseline() # Track through peak to end
```

## 🎯 **Key Algorithm Changes**

### **Detection Strategy:**
- **Before**: Peak-first detection (150g) → look backward for onset
- **After**: Onset-first detection (30g) → track forward through peak

### **Sample Recording:**
- **Before**: Record samples starting from peak detection  
- **After**: Record samples starting from onset detection

### **Timing Assignment:**
- **Before**: Onset = backward-found sample (often wrong)
- **After**: Onset = first recorded sample (always correct)

### **Validation:**
- **Before**: No timing order validation
- **After**: Validates onset < peak timestamps

## 📊 **Expected Corrected Output**

### **Proper Enhanced Impact Detection:**
```
🎯 Complete Impact Event:
  Onset: 09:44:36.123 (32.1g)      ← First crosses 30g threshold
  Peak:  09:44:36.245 (187.3g)     ← Highest magnitude in sequence  
  Onset→Peak: +122ms               ← Positive timing (onset BEFORE peak)
  Duration: 234ms, Samples: 12, Confidence: 0.94
```

### **Correct Correlation:**
```
✅ Correlated Shot #1 → Impact 187.3g (delay: 156ms, confidence: 0.95)
```
**Now using onset timestamp for correlation instead of peak timestamp!**

## 🚀 **System Status: FIXED & READY**

### **Enhanced Impact Detection:**
- ✅ **Onset Detection**: 30g threshold triggers impact recording
- ✅ **Peak Detection**: 150g threshold validates real impacts  
- ✅ **Proper Timing**: Onset always occurs before peak
- ✅ **Accurate Correlation**: Uses onset timestamp for shot correlation

### **Expected Improvements:**
- **Much Better Timing**: Shot→Impact correlation ~150ms instead of ~650ms
- **Higher Confidence**: Proper onset detection increases correlation success
- **Correct Chronology**: Onset timestamps always before peak timestamps
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Captures complete impact progression

## 🎯 **Ready for Final Validation**

**The enhanced impact detection system is now correctly implemented with proper onset-first detection!**

**Test Command:**
```bash
ssh raspberrypi 'cd ~/projects/TinTown && sudo python3 scripts/fixed_bridge.py'
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Onset timestamps **before** peak timestamps
- ✅ Realistic onset magnitudes (30-50g typical)
- ✅ Proper peak magnitudes (150g+ for real impacts)
- ✅ Positive onset→peak timing (+100-300ms typical)
- ✅ Much more accurate shot-impact correlation timing

**Your timing analysis should now show the TRUE impact timing instead of peak timing!** 🎯
