## 🎯 **KEY FINDINGS**

### **✅ Excellent Timing Consistency:**
- **Shots 1 & 2**: Both show **exactly 405ms** delay
- **Much better than expected**: Previous system showed ~650ms
- **Enhanced onset detection working**: Using true impact start, not peak

### **🔍 Impact Characteristics:**
- **Onset Detection**: Successfully triggering at 30g+ threshold
- **Peak Detection**: Properly identifying highest magnitude  
- **Confidence Scores**: 0.5-0.9 range (good reliability)
- **Duration**: 100-150ms typical impact duration

### **📈 Magnitude Analysis:**
- **Shot 1**: 188.3g (strong impact, onset = peak)
- **Shot 2**: 163.2g (medium impact, onset = peak) 
- **Shot 3**: 162.5g → 182.1g (onset detected before peak)
