# TinTown Timing Calibration Analysis & Integration Guide

## Executive Summary

**Analysis Date**: September 11, 2025  
**Data Source**: debug_latest.log + latest_test.ndjson  
**Shots Analyzed**: 6 AMG timer events  
**Impacts Analyzed**: 1,288 BT50 sensor events  
**Correlation Success Rate**: 100% (6/6 shots successfully correlated)

## Key Timing Discoveries

### 1. Baseline Timing Patterns
- **Mean Delay**: 526ms between AMG shot events and BT50 impact detection
- **Delay Range**: 99ms - 906ms (high variability indicates timing inconsistency)
- **Standard Deviation**: 331ms (significant variance in timing)
- **Median Delay**: 526ms (confirms mean accuracy)

### 2. Correlation Details (Shot-by-Shot Analysis)
```
Shot #1 → Impact 194.9g (99ms delay)   - Very fast correlation
Shot #2 → Impact 157.6g (880ms delay)  - Slow correlation  
Shot #3 → Impact 183.6g (561ms delay)  - Near-average timing
Shot #4 → Impact 170.6g (491ms delay)  - Good timing
Shot #5 → Impact 170.7g (219ms delay)  - Fast correlation
Shot #6 → Impact 164.5g (906ms delay)  - Maximum observed delay
```

### 3. Impact Magnitude Statistics
- **Mean Magnitude**: 173.65g
- **Range**: 157.6g - 194.9g
- **Threshold Used**: 150g (all correlated impacts exceeded threshold)

## Calibration Recommendations

### 1. Optimized Parameters
```json
{
  "expected_delay_ms": 526,
  "correlation_window_ms": 1520,
  "delay_tolerance_ms": 663,
  "minimum_magnitude": 150.0,
  "learning_rate": 0.1
}
```

### 2. Correlation Window Calculation
- **Recommended Window**: 1520ms = Mean (526ms) + 3×StdDev (3×331ms)
- **Coverage**: Captures 99.7% of expected timing variations
- **Trade-off**: Wide enough to catch slow correlations, narrow enough to avoid false positives

### 3. Adaptive Learning Parameters
- **Learning Rate**: 0.1 (10% weight to new observations)
- **Sample Buffer**: 20 recent correlations for calibration updates
- **Update Threshold**: ±5ms change required before updating expected delay

## Integration Strategy

### Phase 1: Immediate Integration (Current Sprint)
1. **Load Calibration Config**: Use discovered 526ms delay as baseline
2. **Implement Real-Time Correlation**: Add shot/impact event correlation
3. **Validation Logging**: Track correlation success rates
4. **Adaptive Learning**: Allow system to refine timing based on live data

### Phase 2: Enhanced Validation (Next Sprint)  
1. **Live Testing Session**: Conduct controlled shooting session with known shot count
2. **Timing Drift Detection**: Monitor for systematic timing changes
3. **Multi-Device Correlation**: Test with multiple sensors/timers
4. **Edge Case Handling**: Handle rapid-fire sequences, missed correlations

### Phase 3: Production Optimization (Future)
1. **Environmental Factors**: Correlate timing with temperature, humidity, battery levels
2. **Predictive Correlation**: Use shot patterns to improve correlation accuracy
3. **System Health Monitoring**: Alert on correlation degradation
4. **Historical Analysis**: Long-term timing pattern analysis

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Code Integration Points

#### A. Existing Bridge Modification (scripts/fixed_bridge.py)
```python
# Add to imports
from src.impact_bridge.timing_calibration import RealTimeTimingCalibrator

# Initialize in bridge setup
timing_calibrator = RealTimeTimingCalibrator()

# In AMG frame handler
if frame_type == 0x0103:  # SHOT
    timestamp = datetime.now()
    timing_calibrator.add_shot_event(timestamp, shot_number, device_id)
    logger.info(f"AMG SHOT #{shot_number} detected")

# In BT50 impact detection  
if magnitude >= threshold:
    timestamp = datetime.now()
    timing_calibrator.add_impact_event(timestamp, magnitude, device_id, raw_value)
    logger.info(f"Impact detected: {magnitude:.1f}g")
```

#### B. Logging Enhancement
```python
# Add correlation status to periodic logs
async def log_timing_status():
    stats = timing_calibrator.get_correlation_stats()
    logger.info(f"Timing: {stats['success_rate']*100:.1f}% success, "
               f"delay {stats['avg_delay_ms']}ms±{stats['delay_tolerance_ms']}ms")
```

#### C. Configuration Management
```python
# Save/load calibration parameters
calibration_file = Path("config/timing_calibration.json")
timing_calibrator = RealTimeTimingCalibrator(calibration_file)
```

## Risk Mitigation

### 1. Timing Drift
**Risk**: System timing may change due to hardware/environmental factors  
**Mitigation**: Adaptive learning with 0.1 learning rate, continuous calibration updates

### 2. False Correlations  
**Risk**: Incorrect shot-impact pairings due to wide timing window  
**Mitigation**: 1520ms window balanced with confidence scoring, magnitude thresholds

### 3. Missed Correlations
**Risk**: Valid shot-impact pairs not detected due to timing variations  
**Mitigation**: Wide correlation window (99.7% coverage), adaptive delay adjustment

### 4. System Performance
**Risk**: Correlation processing may impact bridge performance  
**Mitigation**: Async processing, bounded event buffers, periodic cleanup
