## 🧪 Current System Performance

### **Startup Sequence (Verified Working):**
```

[21:00:52.870] 📝 Status: Bridge MCU1 - Bridge Initialized  
[21:00:55.121] 📝 Status: Timer DC:1A - Connected
[21:00:56.288] 📝 Status: Sensor 12:E3 - Connected

[21:00:58.505] 📝 Status: Sensor 12:E3 - Listening
[21:00:58.506] 🎯 Bridge ready for String
```

### **Active Detection Results:**
- **Timer Events:** Shot #1, #2, #3, #4, #5 detected via AMG protocol
- **Impact Detection:** Magnitudes 220, 519, 247, 171 successfully detected
- **Dynamic Baseline:** X=2062 auto-calibrated (vs old hardcoded 2089)
- **Clean Logging:** All verbose data in debug files, clean console output

### **Key Files Deployed:**
- **`scripts/fixed_bridge.py`** - Main production bridge (complete rewrite)
- **`src/impact_bridge/shot_detector.py`** - Shot detection algorithm  
- **Configuration:** Dynamic calibration, no hardcoded values needed

## 🎯 Next Priority: Impact Timing Correlation

### **Current Issue:**
While both timer and sensor detection are working independently, we need to **correlate the timing** between:
- **AMG Timer Events:** "📝 String: Timer DC:1A - Shot #1" (precise shot timing)
- **BT50 Impact Detection:** "📝 Impact Detected: Sensor 12:E3 Mag = 220" (impact magnitude)

### **Observed Timing Gap:**
```
[21:01:04.506] 📝 String: Timer DC:1A - Shot #1
[21:01:04.961] 📝 Impact Detected: Sensor 12:E3 Mag = 220   # +455ms later
```

### **Next Steps Required:**

1. **Analyze Timing Correlation**
   - Extract timestamp data from both timer and sensor events
   - Calculate typical delay between shot trigger and impact detection
   - Determine if 455ms delay is consistent or variable

2. **Implement Shot-Impact Pairing**
   - Create correlation algorithm to match timer shots with sensor impacts
   - Add configurable timing window for shot-impact association
   - Handle multiple impacts per shot or missed correlations

3. **Enhanced Event Logging**  
   - Add shot-impact pair IDs to correlate events
   - Include timing analysis in event logs
   - Provide statistics on correlation accuracy

4. **Validation Testing**
   - Test with known shot sequences to validate correlation
   - Analyze edge cases (rapid fire, missed shots, false impacts)
   - Refine timing windows based on real-world data

### **Expected Outcome:**
```
[21:01:04.506] 📝 String: Timer DC:1A - Shot #1
[21:01:04.961] 📝 Impact Correlated: Shot #1 → Impact 220mg (455ms delay)
```
